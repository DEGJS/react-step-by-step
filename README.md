# Welcome to React Training

## How It Works
This isn't a tutorial. You won't follow a set of directions step-by-step.
Instead, you will get an application at a certain state, a failing test that
will pass once you learn and apply the concepts, and a set of goals with
pointers to resources.

Think of it as a self-guided tour through React. The goal isn't to have you copy
and paste or read a wall of text, the goal is to make you code and to learn
through trial and error.
